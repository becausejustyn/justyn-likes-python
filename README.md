    <strong>What's In a Title?</strong><br>
The <strong>gradient</strong> is a vector that tells us in what direction the weights need to go. More precisely, it tells us how to change the weights to make the loss change <em>fastest</em>. We call our process gradient <strong>descent</strong> because it uses the gradient to <em>descend</em> the loss curve towards a minimum. <strong>Stochastic</strong> means "determined by chance." Our training is <em>stochastic</em> because the minibatches are <em>random samples</em> from the dataset. And that's why it's called SGD!
